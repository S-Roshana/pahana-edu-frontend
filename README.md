📘 **Pahana Edu Frontend**

This is the frontend application for the Pahana Edu Online Bookshop.
It is built with React.js and designed to provide a smooth, interactive user experience for customers — including features like:

Landing page
Login / Register forms
Customer dashboard
Profile management
Order history view
The app interacts with the Spring Boot backend via REST APIs.

1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/S-Roshana/pahana-edu-frontend.git

**Start the app on http://localhost:3000**
